##CodSoft Internship Projects

During my internship at CodSoft, I worked on three machine learning projects, applying various natural language processing and predictive modeling techniques. Below is an overview of each project:

1. Movie Genre Prediction ðŸŽ¬
Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.
Techniques & Models:

Feature Extraction: TF-IDF, Word Embeddings
Classifiers: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal


2. Customer Churn Prediction ðŸ“‰
Objective: Predict customer churn for a subscription-based service using historical customer data, including behavioral patterns and demographics.
Techniques & Models:

Feature Engineering: Usage behavior analysis, demographic segmentation
Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision-Recall, AUC-ROC


3. SMS Spam Classification ðŸ“©
Objective: Build an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.
Techniques & Models:

Feature Extraction: TF-IDF, Word Embeddings
Classifiers: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Data Cleaning: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming
